# GUTS-2
Project for GUTS 2019, done in 48 hours!

### The Trashy Game
This is a game written with **Java** & the *Processing* library to support recycling.

In this game the player will flight against increasing trash output from cities over the course of the game.
The player has a limited supply of money and will need to buy recycling plants to make money.
These recycling plants will have different effects when placed near each other (*see below*).

### Units
TODO

### Contributing
As this game was written for a Hackathon, we do not intend to update it at all after the hackathon.
Both pull requests & issues will be **unmonitored**.

If you want to work more with this game please *fork* the repo.

### Dependencies
We only depend upon `processing` & `processing-sound`, you can download Processing [here](https://processing.org) & place the libraries from the `Processing` & `Processing Sound` (when added from the Processing IDE) to the `libs` folder if the ones supplied don't work.
